# Dinamycally_Growing_Arrays
## Program devloped when I was taking the course of Data Structures as part of my degree in Programming. 
## Objective: 
### Research and write a C++ program to create a custom, class-based implementation of a Stack.
### Using an array-based storage mechanism.
### Implement their most common operations (push, pop, peek, etcâ€¦).
### Use industry standard naming conventions when implementing the operations.
### The array implementation of the Stack will need to automatically grow once nearing
### capacity and shrink once capacity is returned. Use standard techniques for array growth/management.
